       "  'review_content': \"I was looking for durable cable for my ipad cause the cable apple provides in the box feels pretty flimsy, and doesn't really inspire confidence. Also, i use my Ipad primarily for gaming, so it is almost always connected to my pc while gaming.So, i needed a really sturdy cable, that could charge, sync and and feel good while doing it.And this cable does the job perfectly!!It is sturdy. My ipad has taken a few drops my table and was saved my this cable. Even after 3 months of daily abuse, this cable has no signs of wear and tear.The charge speed is the same as the original apple cable. And so is the sync speed.One thing this cable does better than the original cable is the connection quality. It hardly ever accidentally breaks the connection while moving around too much, which was a problem with my original cable.I'm very satisfied with the purchase and i even have a spare one in case of an emergency.,Quality cable material. It feels durable. Charges my iPhone just fine. Thanks Amazon.,,,The product is good, build quality is good and does what's said in the description of the product. But it stopped working within 6 months of usage. The prod was ordered in Apr 22 and now in Sept 22 its  not charging the phone at all.I have contacted Amazon for the same and looking forward for their help.,Used it as a back up to charge phone in car. Apple car play has stopped working intermittently when using this cable,Good product but phn was getting heat while its chrgeing,This cable is working great. It’s durable and charging power is also good.Recommended👍\"},\n",

Charging time is good with availability of different cable types.,Considering the price compared to competitors at market, this is cheap, but no compromises have been made with respect to sturdiness or quality.

The quality of the ports are also solid, no issue had been faced at all.Packaging was great, performance of the product even greater. The wires are long enough, though in my personal opinion, a little bit more lengthy would be icing on the cake, making the product absolutely a perfect one!Overall, very happy with purchasing it.

       "  'review_content': \"The biggest issue with buying an accessory for an Apple product from a non-apple supplier is you will never know if this will work. This products is working. I used it an old iPod touch. I am able to charge and transfer data. I hope the product has good shelf-life as well. Value for money,After a bad experience with FastX charging cable for iPad, I was apprehensive to buy any such thing online. But, then I decided to try once more with Amkette.To my delight, the cable fitted the port and started charging the iPad. Charging is slower than the original Apple cable, but it will do if you're not a heavy user.Good value for money. I hope it works for more than 6 months, at least.,I loose the hope to revive my iPhone4 I found in some old items. old cable was damaged and not able to charge it. I ordered the cable just to check if my old iPhone can revive even after almost 7-8 years without charging. Got the cable on time and the quality of packing and cable look impressive and to my surprize my phone got charged and started working. I am thankful the cable helped me to revive my old phone.,Working with iPod perfectly.,Not a good product,Fits well 100% fast charging great product.,My iPad 2 become live again,Very good condition and its useful for me\"},\n",

       "  'review_content': \"Yeap this cable support 65w fast charging tested on my 65w brick of realme 7 pro..Cable and pins quality looks good.Since i couldnt find original cable for 65w charger of realme i was searching for long time for a good one...,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand's inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I've been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.,Got the original one, but there are fake cables being sold, so beware.It warp charges as it supports 6A power supply. The cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical OnePlus cable in the box. The price of original OnePlus cable is 890 mrp but this i got for 400 and is not unlike other third party wires. Definitely worth it. 👍🏻,Best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsi,Amazon send me a used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me a used product by others if not it's super product and 3 year's of warranty on it just buy it,Very good quality fast charging cable, getting good quick charging through laptop also.Flat cable design makes it more durable.,I have a OnePlus 7t with 30 Watts charge,My original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for a cable with 6v-5a for fast charging, I had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as 5he original one. This wire has a good build quality and can do 65 watts (6.5a).\"},\n",

Nice Product & Highly Recommended.,Good quality and looks beautiful... I will surely recommend,( After using it for 3 weeks). I use Samsung M51, few months back my USB Cable was torn, so I wasn't able to fast charge. It took a decade to charge from 20-90%. Samsung original cable was too pricey and too flimsy, so I was searching for something durable. While browsing through the product page I was skeptical to place an order, as the company claimed too many features in such a low price. Keeping the negative thoughts aside I ordered it anyhow. The product was delivered well in advance, which made me happy.I unboxed and plugged in the cable, to my surprise the cable delivered everything that the company claimed. The ends have aluminum casing which makes it durable and away from regular wear and tear, it has LED indicator on both ends which turns on when the charger is plugged to the phone. Also, the box that it comes with has a secret code that you need to scratch to reveal which helps to check its authenticity.It easily fast charges my phone in an hour. Overall, I'm very happy with the product.I highly recommend this cable to anyone who needs a fast charging Type C to C cable.Will update this review if any change is observed.\"},\n",

       "  'review_content': \"Go for it with out second thought.,It works well in my New Kia Carens Car. Excellent product my daughter enjoys charging her Mobile sitting in Second row 👍👌🌹🙏,Value for money,You can easily transfer files between two android phones, one with micro USB port and the other with USB C.You can also charge your phone, it supports 5V,3A fast charging (upto 15W)The product didn't look new to me since it had yellow stains on it..and little dirty at the two connector ends. Well, it's working as it should so that's that.It's functional and serving the purpose that I got it for.AmazonBasics products are generally good. Have used quite a few of them, mostly cables and they are durable.Hope this helps.,Good product,If you are a MacBook 2016 user, you only have USB C ports and have to carry dongles to manage cables. This little cable makes life easy. It is reasonably high quality, not too long (around 6 inches) and can be used to connect all your micro USB devices without an additional dongle - think phones, power banks, wifi dongles, etc. It has proved to be a lifesaver many times!,Connects an android device to faster versions of new generation laptops/PC/MacBooks USB c / thunderbolt ports. Quality of cable is similar to apple original cable, ports are perfect fit in any port. Data transfer speed is amazing , a must buy for all MacBook m1 owners.,Very good quality and finish. The cable could have been thicker. However solves the purpose of connecting your device to external source. I am using this small adapter cable to connect my note 8 (which has usb c port) to my external Dac Chord mojo( has micro usb port) to listen to my hd resolution music files. Now I dont need to connect a otg adapter along with a usb a to usb b cable.\"},\n",

Nice Product & Highly Recommended.,Good quality and looks beautiful... I will surely recommend,( After using it for 3 weeks). I use Samsung M51, few months back my USB Cable was torn, so I wasn't able to fast charge. It took a decade to charge from 20-90%. Samsung original cable was too pricey and too flimsy, so I was searching for something durable. While browsing through the product page I was skeptical to place an order, as the company claimed too many features in such a low price. Keeping the negative thoughts aside I ordered it anyhow. The product was delivered well in advance, which made me happy.I unboxed and plugged in the cable, to my surprise the cable delivered everything that the company claimed. The ends have aluminum casing which makes it durable and away from regular wear and tear, it has LED indicator on both ends which turns on when the charger is plugged to the phone. Also, the box that it comes with has a secret code that you need to scratch to reveal which helps to check its authenticity.It easily fast charges my phone in an hour. Overall, I'm very happy with the product.I highly recommend this cable to anyone who needs a fast charging Type C to C cable.Will update this review if any change is observed.\"},\n",

       "  'review_content': \"Sufficient length,excellent build quality ,good alternative to generic cables,Strong cable, the cable ends are nearly like rubber. GOLD coated. Cable is also of high thickness.,Why I bought this ?I have DVR rack, for DVR which is far above the reach limit hence I need a mouse to be connected to the USB port of the DVR which is in the rack above reachAny alternatives?Wireless mouse didn't work well with my particular DVR, had lots of lag,  hence I had to resort to a USB port extender with ample lengthResult :Very sturdy cable able to connect to my DVR and connection is stable .Amazon basics is very reliable.,This cable is good for any device that needs extension over USB 2.0 like printers, TVs, gaming consoles, keyboards etc.The build quality is good. Cable material is soft so it will not break. Connectors are gold plated and will not rust.But remember, this cable will not give USB 3.0 speeds even if you connect it to a USB 3.0 port.,For Usb 2.0 , any usb 3.0 if used will behave as usb 2.0Type: ADirection: female to maleFunction: extension of length of usbBuilt: average  not cloth/fibre braiderLength: as mentionedWorks for all connections: yes [including pc\\\\printer\\\\console pen drive etc ],Product is as per description,Good as expected.\"},\n",

       "  'review_content': 'Cable is working propely but the price is on a higher side.,Good Quality,Cable was too short,Hello everyone,Do not go for this .beacuse it says 5gbs transfer speed but it has a very slow speed in comparison to the original cable I got from Seagate company. my original cable shows the cut and copies speed to SSD like 30 to 150mbs ps per second. But this cable does around 10 to 80mbs  mostly. The cable is also very thin in size, the original Seagate had is very thick and sturdy.  At the end speed matters.so if u have like 2 or 4TB external hard drive it will load slowly after connecting, folders keep loading and loading. So, I would rather suggest to please go with a 10 GBS speed cable which will have a 3.1 type c cable.,Worth the money,Plug fits little tight to the port, might damage the port on longer use. But does the job well.,It is a good product. Works with all the laptops and hard drives. Value for money. Recomended product,GOOD'},\n",

       "  'review_content': \"Good,Using it for Samsung Z Fold 4 with an Ambrane 30W charger.Fast charging works. Side on design is very practical.Sturdy build. Well worth the money.,Very useful,Very nice in this price range,The cable quality is great and its built well, both sides are L shaped connectors ( 1 side of the cable should have been regular as L shaper port blocks other ports and if you have a mobile stand you can't use this cable.Its very bad for data transfer even a 1 gb file takes 5 or more minutes.Great for charging, supports fast charging as well. If you want a cable just for charging your phone its great.Updating review after getting a replacement, now it doesn't even fast charge my phone. Returned it.,Product is good.But sometimes there are little bit charging problem seen.It shows disconnected from charging while it is plugged in.BTW, some weeks later it eaten by our goat😂Then I bought one new.,Best quality cable at best price,Short review: Go for it if you are looking for a C2C charging cable at 60W or less. Sturdy and stylish with an added advantage of 90° connectors.[Deal price: ₹139]Long review:I have been using Portronics products lately and I have to appreciate the quality and innovation they bring to the end users.Products I own from Portronics: • My Buddy k3 • Brillo 3 • Power Plate 7 • Mobot one • Clamp M • Konnect LAll the products I bought from Portronics not just met my expectations but they performed beyond that. It made me start building trust on the brand.I use S21 ultra which can be charged at 25W and this cable supports the same with the Samsung's original charger. I strongly believe the product would work at the rated power delivery (60W).It looks and feels sturdy and I am expecting it to be durable too.The 90° ends keep the cables away without out interfering with the work space. Works the best when playing battle royale games as the cable won't come in the way.The grey and black colour combination works as a charm and would blend in with Apple devices.Data transfer speeds are yet to be tested. I will update here once I have enough inputs on the same.After using multiple cables from Ambrane, Wayona, Wecool, and more brands Portronics definitely stands as a good contender for all of them that serve the same purpose.Verdict: I would definitely recommend this Type-c to Type-c cable if you need to charge devices at 60W or less.\"},\n",

       "  'review_title': \"Good product,Its good, but micro usb doesn't fit my phone.,Good and useful item,It is very best cable,good,2 in 1 Charging Cable.,Sturdy cable overall,Nice & Best Charger Cabel\",\n",
       "  'review_content': \"Product is good , and also it's  strudiness .But no fast charging in this cable , it's normally charging . I love it because it's supported in micro usb , or type c . Over all good .Pros / advantage :- -1) 1.5 meter wire  2) more durable3) supported dual mode type c , micro usbCons / disadvantages:- normal charging , not fast charging,Though it is braided, but it is not strong like boAt. But it's okay to use it. Supports turbocharging.,Working well after months of use. Only thing is that if there is slight pressure, the C -type adapter will come off from the micro usb head. So better to see that the cable is not stretched when using the C type adapter. Otherwise working fine and very convenient for me since i usually have a phone with C type charging and a small Tab with micro USB charging when i travel. I need to carry only one cable now with my powerbank. Will recommend.,Best cable,good,Both Micro USB & Type C mobile connector's are getting charge.Good Decision to purchase this product.,Cable is a good fibre braided with good length.The connector also has a tight fit, sometimes you have to apply a bit force to remove(ig it'll wear off after usage).In comparison, boat has a better quality i would say if u get that in offer as it has metal braided cable and better quality microusb pin.,I like the product bcuz it's help me to charge both phone Type C & Micro Cabel\"},\n",

       "  'review_content': \"ABOUT  AMAZONBASICS:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in 2009 & is Amazon’s own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.Here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn’t an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn’t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger’s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it’s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can’t be termed as thin or delicate too. It’s not the thickest I’ve seen but then thickest doesn’t always means most durable. Given my application it’s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.\"},\n",

I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.\"},\n",

       "  'review_content': \"ABOUT  AMAZONBASICS:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in 2009 & is Amazon’s own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.Here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn’t an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn’t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger’s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it’s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can’t be termed as thin or delicate too. It’s not the thickest I’ve seen but then thickest doesn’t always means most durable. Given my application it’s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.\"},\n",

Stop writing negative reviews after using this cable for something that it was NOT intended for.Can confirm that it is ~1.2m as most other products and not 1.5m as the seller claims both in title and on stickers on the product.No review mentions this. But I needed a 1.5m length for perfect use. So disappointed as I have to rotate the cooling pad and use it (cable falls short by around 15cm).,It works well. The cable is soft and flexible. In all probability, it will last long also.,But pover quality\"},\n",

Overall fine.,I like the usb c  L shape. Nylon Shielded core wire it improves the life of the cable.,i think i buy these every 6 months or so. fast charging stops working after a while. probbly something to do with the cable design. the cable gets twisted over time and I suspect that breaks the high capacity wires inside. but i keep buying it because there arent too many options in an L shaped design,Good and durable product. Sometime the charges doesn't work on few adapters. there might be few cut off or something but works fine on apple adapter, Car charger, USB,The product is really good at affordable price.,Good and fast charging, and value for money,பொருள் உடைய கடினத்தன்மையின் நன்றாக உள்ளது சார்ஜ் ஏறும் வேகம் 15wat,Not a fast charger.
